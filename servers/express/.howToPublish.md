## To Build

- You need  a Github personal access token, by the way.

```
docker build -t docker.pkg.github.com/arekusunaito/raspberry-docker-services/express:0.1 .
docker push docker.pkg.github.com/arekusunaito/raspberry-docker-services/express:0.1
```

## To Pull

```
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/arekusunaito/raspberry-docker-services/express:0.1
```

Apparently, depending on which machine you `docker BUILD` is the architecture that will stick. The solution I had to run the container was to `docker build` on the raspberry-pi itself so the architecture stays to `linux/arm

You will get the following error if you build the image on windows:

WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm/v7) and no specific platform


Short-answer: Build on the raspberry pi and push on raspberry pi, after all, these services are made.

You can develop/test and more on windows, but the build/push must be done on the proper architecture. (At least that's the information I got so far)
